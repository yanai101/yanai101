### Hey there! 👋 I'm Yanai

🧑‍💻 Fullstack Web Developer | 17+ years of building for the web  
🌱 Lifelong learner, tech enthusiast, and AI explorer  
❤️ Open-source believer & active community contributor

I’m passionate about creating clean, meaningful code — and just as passionate about helping others grow.  
Whether it’s through sharing knowledge, contributing to projects, or just being part of the dev conversation — I’m here for it.

✨ Topics I enjoy:
- Building modern web applications (frontend & backend)
- Working with a wide range of technologies — JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, SQL, and always learning more (including Python 🐍)
- Exploring AI and how it connects with real-world development
- Creating tools that solve real problems and empower others
